# STOPWATCH

This project is a simple stopwatch built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes the following features:

✅ Start/Pause: Begin or pause the stopwatch timer.
✅ Lap Recording: Save lap times while the stopwatch is running.
✅ Reset Timer: Reset the stopwatch to 00:00:00.
✅ Clear Laps: Remove all recorded lap times.
✅ Animated UI: The background color smoothly transitions when the timer is running.

The project uses JavaScript intervals to update time in milliseconds, seconds, and minutes, ensuring accuracy. The buttons dynamically appear or hide based on the stopwatch's state.
